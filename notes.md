I am doing this because I want to learn more about AIs in general, and I want to learn how to build them from scratch.
I also want to learn more about the math behind them.

it will contain not only llm stuff but also classic machine learning stuff like linear regressions, decision trees, random forests, etc.

I decided to use C as the main programming language. Well, let's see how it goes. Maybe I will regret it later.
